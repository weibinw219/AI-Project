# Abstract
Abalone is the large marine gastropod mollusk, which is usually used as food consumption for human beings. This research is looking to predict the Abalone's age based on various features such as sex, length, diameter, etc. The dataset used is from UCL Machine Learning repository. The rings inside of the Abalone will be addd 1.5 to respresents the age in year. I will be using various models, including AdaBoost Regressor, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. among the models, Gradient Boosting Regressor seems to have the best peformance overall, while the processing speed is not outstanding ocompared to other models.
